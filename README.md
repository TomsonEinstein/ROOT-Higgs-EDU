# RootUsing
In Root Session,
 - Type .L [filename].C to open the file and then use the functions through typing [functionname] ().
 - Type .x [filename].C to run the macros directly.
 - Type .x [filename].C+ to compile and run the macros.This will cost you more time in compilation.But it is much faster to run.
  
The folder tutorials contain basic outputs and source codes in using ROOT,which comes from Youtube "Physics Matter"'s ROOT Tutorial Video series.

The folder TMVAUserGuide contains notes when we are studying TMVA.

The folder HZZAnalysis contains the codes and files to operate HZZAnalysis in ATLAS 13tev dataset.It doesn't contain the neccessary data because it is large and it's unneccessary to put it on Github.
