                         : 
                         : Fisher discriminants select events by distinguishing the mean 
                         : values of the signal and background distributions in a trans- 
                         : formed variable space where linear correlations are removed.
                         : 
                         :    (More precisely: the "linear discriminator" determines
                         :     an axis in the (correlated) hyperspace of the input 
                         :     variables such that, when projecting the output classes 
                         :     (signal and background) upon this axis, they are pushed 
                         :     as far as possible away from each other, while events
                         :     of a same class are confined in a close vicinity. The  
                         :     linearity property of this classifier is reflected in the 
                         :     metric with which "far apart" and "close vicinity" are 
                         :     determined: the covariance matrix of the discriminating
                         :     variable space.)
                         : 
                         : --- Performance optimisation:
                         : 
                         : Optimal performance for Fisher discriminants is obtained for 
                         : linearly correlated Gaussian-distributed variables. Any deviation
                         : from this ideal reduces the achievable separation power. In 
                         : particular, no discrimination at all is achieved for a variable
                         : that has the same sample mean for signal and background, even if 
                         : the shapes of the distributions are very different. Thus, Fisher 
                         : discriminants often benefit from suitable transformations of the 
                         : input variables. For example, if a variable x in [-1,1] has a 
                         : a parabolic signal distributions, and a uniform background
                         : distributions, their mean value is zero in both cases, leading 
                         : to no separation. The simple transformation x -> |x| renders this 
                         : variable powerful for the use in a Fisher discriminant.
