## How to run files in ROOT
In Root Session,
 - Type .L [filename].C to open the file and then use the functions through typing [functionname] ().
 - Type .x [filename].C to run the macros directly.
 - Type .x [filename].C+ to compile and run the macros.This will cost you more time in compilation.But it is much faster to run.
